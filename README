Assignment #4, A Distributed Flock of Lyrebirds

The program decyptes tweets(max char size 254) by using server-client network
and provided algorithm. The server reads config file which contains input encrypted file path/name
and output decrypted file path/name, and then sends the file path/name to connected clients. Clients
decrypt and tells server whether the task is completed successfully.

Usage:

1. compile the programe: type 'make' in terminal  at the program directory
2. execute the server first : ./lyrebird.server <config_file> <log_file>, the console should display the
   server ip address and port for client program to connect
3. execute the client: ./lyrebird.client <server ip adrress> <port>

4. to remove the executables, log files, objects files: type 'make clean' in terminal at the program directory

p.s the programe is incompleted, it only starts the server and take client connection. Server does not send task to clients
